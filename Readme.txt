The purpose of the Dynamic Round Robin Generator is to create round robin matches for any number of players in any configuration, such as 2v2, 1v1v1v1 or whatever.

It uses a simple greedy algorithm to balance matches over the course of a league.

The Dynamic Round Robin Generator is specifically tailored to the Quark Y-smash League


new features:
-you can have a roster of any size and if you dont have enough players to create a match, it will generate fill-in players to the roster

-You can change player names in the editor

-You can add more players to the roster with an add player button

-in the case of removing players, you could either just rename them to a fill-in or you might have to manually get your hands dirty directly editing the CSV.

-you can always edit the CSV to fix results of times people have matched up with each other
